Valeria Araujo,YES YES YES!,Reviewed in the United States on April 15 2020,Mutter nonsense is the type of game that will have you and your friends rolling in laughter every time you play making it a staple party game! It‚Äôs super easy to use and brings out a creative and fun atmosphere. I‚Äôve never not had a good time playing the game!

David Kaye,Innovative use of Alexa,Reviewed in the United States on April 5 2020,Pretty innovative.  I‚Äôll look forward to future versions.  Might be helpful to find another way to get the room code. I did like not having to download an app. I wondered if a future version might support multiple locations (not in the same room).,Mutter Nonsense,40  customer ratings,4.2 out of 5

Beth,What's the damn address??,Reviewed in the United States on April 25 2020,I have tried to check out this game but the required web address is spoken so fast I can't catch it!
